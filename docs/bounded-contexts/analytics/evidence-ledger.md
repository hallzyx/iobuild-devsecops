# Analytics evidence ledger

## Backend test navigation — 2026-10-02

The [Analytics catalogue](test-catalog.md) maps dashboard, access, read queries
and live-read parser/adapter boundaries. [Reorganization evidence](../../../backend/tests/reorganization-evidence.md)
records source/discovery preservation, local suite results and an inherited
static-cooldown/order dependency. No live-Influx/MySQL or CI pass is claimed.

See the [crosscutting frontend performance report](../../performance/evidence-ledger.md)
for shared gzip/cache/chunks, functional E2E evidence and the new local
mobile/desktop Lighthouse audit of `/analytics/dashboard` for Builder and Owner.
The original two-route IAM comparison is preserved separately. Local observations
do not establish CI acceptance or all-state performance coverage.

The central round-two entry records canonical `/analytics` redirect regression
tests, shared header accessibility and baseline CPU noise. Polling/freshness is
unchanged; vendor/CPU optimization is deferred with owner/date there.

mutations:
  - mutant: ownership checks removed (any user reads any dashboard)
    killed_by: AnalyticsAccessTests self-match and scoping tests
  - mutant: projection self-sync removed (dashboards go empty)
    killed_by: dashboard data tests asserting seeded metrics
  - mutant: per-user sync gate removed (parallel loads double-insert)
    killed_by: Concurrent_dashboards 6-way stress (proven red with duplicate-key 500s without the gate during development)
  - mutant: energy clamp removed (absurd windows pass through)
    killed_by: ENERGY_WINDOW clamp test
skip_reasons: []
commands:
  - command: dotnet test backend/tests/Modules --filter AnalyticsAccessTests
    result: 2/2 passed (metrics/energy self-match with 403 cross and 401 anonymous; insights scoped to owned projects)
  - command: npm run test:unit (frontend)
    result: 39/39 passed (validators 7/7 + iam-contract 7/7 + subscriptions-contract 7/7 + profiles-contract 6/6 + devices-contract 5/5 + publishing-contract 4/4 + analytics-contract 3/3, last local run)
  - command: dotnet test backend/tests/Modules --filter AnalyticsDashboardTests
    result: 3/3 passed (builder and owner dashboard data, energy window clamp)
  - command: IOBUILD_TEST_MYSQL_CONNECTION=... dotnet test --filter Dashboards_and_projections_are_durable_on_mysql (temporary 3306:3306 mapping, reverted afterwards)
    result: 1/1 passed against live MySQL 8.0 (both dashboards with data plus project/unit/device projection durability); probe rows cleaned
  - command: E2E_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8081 npx playwright test (deployed nginx + dist + API + MySQL)
    result: analytics-view.spec.js 2/2 green (Builder dashboard with own project metrics, Owner dashboard view); full suite 11/11; e2e and seeded rows cleaned afterwards
artifacts: []
failures:
  - class: product
    evidence_for: [parallel dashboard loads double-inserted projections and 500d the losers on duplicate primary keys]
    evidence_against: [projection self-sync assumes a quiet tenant]
    verdict: per-user-id async gate around both dashboard queries (same in-process idiom as device locks; multi-instance would need a database arbiter); stress-proven 3/3 with single projection rows
  - class: product
    evidence_for: [all 5 analytics routes answered anonymously for any user id, including PII-adjacent consumption metrics]
    evidence_against: [every frontend caller passes its own user id]
    verdict: RequireAuthorization plus token-id self-match on metric/energy routes (403 on mismatch); insights scoped to builder-owned or unit-occupied projects (404 otherwise)
