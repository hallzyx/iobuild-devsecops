# IAM evidence ledger

See the [crosscutting frontend performance report](../../performance/evidence-ledger.md)
for the verbatim 2026-09-29 evidence, shared gzip/cache/chunks, deferred
Cloudinary and auth hero preload. The original `/iam/login` and
`/iam/register-owner` comparison is preserved; a new mobile/desktop audit adds
`/iam/register-builder` and scoped authenticated routes across contexts, not all
IAM or application states. Broad E2E evidence remains functional regression
coverage. Performance results remain
local-only with CI acceptance pending; the historical IAM gates and Owner
registration evidence below are separate and preserved.

The central report also records surgical round-two stepper semantics, shared
contrast/font scheduling, real clipboard diagnosis and repeated local full-suite
evidence; both registration forms measure A100 in their initial audited state.

artifacts:
  - Playwright trace/screenshot/video on failure (configured: trace on-first-retry, screenshot only-on-failure, video retain-on-failure)
failures:
  - class: product
    evidence_for: [Tier D oversized payload accepted by InMemory-backed workflow]
    evidence_against: [unit tests green, contract tests green]
    verdict: missing authoritative input guard; fixed with fail-closed email/password guard mapped to HTTP 400
  - class: product
    evidence_for: [Tier A registration with role Admin returned 201 and minted an Admin JWT claim accepted by cutover admin gates]
    evidence_against: [business rule requires unknown roles rejected; endpoint tests green for Builder/Owner]
    verdict: missing role whitelist; fixed with fail-closed Builder/Owner whitelist plus canonical casing, mapped to HTTP 400
  - class: product
    evidence_for: [Tier A concurrent duplicate registration threw DbUpdateException 1062, surfacing HTTP 500 instead of idempotent success]
    evidence_against: [sequential duplicate tests green; business rule requires idempotent duplicates]
    verdict: check-then-insert race on the unique email index; fixed by converting error 1062 into idempotent return after detaching the failed insert
  - class: test
    evidence_for: [legacy MySQL lease test leased foreign rows and self-polluted on failure against the shared dev outbox table]
    evidence_against: [InMemory lease mechanics green]
    verdict: test assumed a quiet table; fixed with scoped cleanup plus a quiet-table guard; stale pre-existing rows removed with owner approval and the full proof re-ran green, leaving the table at zero rows
open_risks:
  - risk: Tier B/C browser scenarios declared, not automated (conflicting tab sessions, token expiry mid-session, navigate-away during auth) — flaky-prone, revisit on cadence
    owner: ccarita-tech
    review_by: 2026-10-01
  - risk: Tier D resource-pressure experiments and corrupt-dependency injection now covered (50-burst, malformed auth, megabyte payload, dead-database fail-fast)
    owner: ccarita-tech
    review_by: 2026-10-01
    disposition: closed by evidence, kept for cadence review
  - risk: MigrateAsync with an explicit target migration throws not-found on MySQL although the migration is listed (production uses EnsureCreated, so no production impact; targeted downgrade path unproven)

    review_by: 2026-10-01
roles_covered:

  - role: Builder
    happy_path: frontend/tests/e2e/iam-builder.spec.js
owner_unit_assignment_registration:
  journey: An Owner registers only after a builder assigns an existing unit to their email.
  actor_coverage:
    - actor: Owner with assigned unit
      outcome: Registration completes; existing auto-linking attaches the account to the unit.
    - actor: Owner without assigned unit
      outcome: Frontend disables Next and backend rejects direct registration with 403.
    - actor: Builder
      outcome: Registration remains available without a unit assignment.
  scenarios:
    - tier: A
      scenario: Unassigned Owner registration is rejected before user/dispatch persistence.
      owner: backend/tests/Modules/IamWorkflowTests.cs
    - tier: A
      scenario: Both public registration routes reject unassigned Owners; assigned-owner registration remains successful.
      owner: backend/tests/Modules/IamWorkflowTests.cs
    - tier: B
      scenario: Invitation lookup failure disables Next and blocks the Owner form from progressing.
      owner: frontend/tests/e2e/iam-form-feedback.spec.js
  layer_ownership:
    G0: RegisterUserWorkflow tests prove no user or dispatch is persisted without an assigned unit.
    G1: IamApiContractTests prove both public signup routes return the explicit 403 contract.
    G2: Playwright proves Owner rejection/assigned-unit success and Builder registration success against the running MySQL-backed stack.
    G3: Direct API bypass and invitation-service outage are both covered as fail-closed scenarios.
    G4: Final six-journey rerun passed against an isolated Docker Compose stack.
  convergence_points:
    - Invitation lookup assigned/unitId matches backend eligibility rule.
    - Rejected backend signup leaves login unauthorized for that email.
    - Existing Owner auto-linking succeeds when Unit.OwnerEmail or Client.UnitId associates a real unit.

      result: 3/3 passed; E2E asserts the Next button is disabled and gray (rgb(156, 163, 175)) for missing assignments, and enabled for an assigned Owner.
  diagnostic_verdicts:
    - failure: Initial E2E locator matched visible/inactive step panels strictly.
      verdict: Test assertion issue; scoped visible-message assertion and hidden-step assertion fixed it; final five-test run passed.
    - failure: E2E attempted clicking Next after email blur had already started assignment lookup and disabled the button.
      verdict: Expected product behavior; tests now assert the lookup feedback and disabled state produced by blur.
