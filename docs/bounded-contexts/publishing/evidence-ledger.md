# Publishing evidence ledger

## Core entity tests and behavior scenarios — 2026-10-02

Added isolated entity tests for Publishing `Unit` and `Client`, plus Given/When/Then-style test names and a scenario index shared with Subscriptions. These are domain-level tests with no database or external dependencies; no production behavior changed. The scenarios are documented in [Core entity tests and behavior scenarios](../../testing/core-entity-and-behavior-scenarios.md).

```yaml
context: publishing
feature: core-entity-tests-and-behavior-scenarios
journey: Unit ownership state and client profile/unit association behavior are specified as observable domain outcomes.
actor_coverage: []
scenarios:
  - scenario: Unit construction defaults room number and availability; assigning and clearing owner updates owner data and status.
    owner: backend/tests/Modules/Publishing/Units/Domain/UnitEntityTests.cs
  - scenario: Client construction keeps supplied details and update replaces profile/unit association.
    owner: backend/tests/Modules/Publishing/Clients/Domain/ClientEntityTests.cs
layer_ownership:
  G0: Domain unit tests assert entity behavior without infrastructure.
  G1: skipped — no API, persistence, or external boundary changed.
  G2: skipped — no user-visible behavior changed; this work adds evidence only.
  G3: skipped — no risk-bearing product behavior changed.
  G4: skipped — CI was not run from this workspace.
gates:
  G0: passed
  G1: skipped — no boundary changed.
  G2: skipped — no product behavior changed.
  G3: skipped — no risk-bearing behavior changed.
  G4: skipped — CI was not run from this workspace.
commands:
  - command: dotnet test backend/tests/Modules/IoBuild.Modules.Tests.csproj --no-restore --filter "Layer=Domain" --verbosity minimal
    result: 7/7 passed for Publishing entity tests (9/9 across the Domain layer filter).
  - command: dotnet test backend/tests/Modules/IoBuild.Modules.Tests.csproj --no-restore --verbosity minimal
    result: 171/171 passed; no tests skipped.

## Backend test navigation — 2026-10-02

The [Publishing catalogue](test-catalog.md) maps management, structure, units
and clients to the unchanged scenarios. [Reorganization evidence](../../../backend/tests/reorganization-evidence.md)
records local source/discovery preservation and solution runs; it does not claim
new relational atomicity, runtime-stack or CI acceptance.

See the [crosscutting frontend performance report](../../performance/evidence-ledger.md)
for shared gzip/cache/chunks, functional E2E evidence and the new local
mobile/desktop Lighthouse audit of Builder project list/create/detail and client
list/detail. Exact routes and fixture scope are in the central report. Local
observations do not establish CI acceptance or all-state performance coverage.

The central round-two matrix remeasures these routes after shared header/theme
changes and runs the complete publishing journey twice. No Publishing business
behavior or context-specific CPU optimization changed.

artifacts: []
failures:
  - class: test
    evidence_for: [per-builder cleanup hardcoded to one id left Dupe Towers rows behind across reruns]
    evidence_against: [all other tables cleaned by key]
    verdict: cleanup parameterized by builder id; proven by zero leftovers after consecutive runs
  - class: product
    evidence_for: [project read/update/delete, structure definition, unit creation/assignment, and client create/read/update/delete enforced login but zero ownership]
    evidence_against: [project list already scoped to caller]
    verdict: token-builder ownership on every mutating and item route (403 on explicit mismatch, 404 on foreign ids, creation bound to caller); unfiltered unit and client lists stay visible by design, recorded as scheduled risks
open_risks:
  - risk: unfiltered unit listing has no per-role visibility scoping

roles_covered:

    happy_path: frontend/tests/e2e/publishing-manage.spec.js
client_tenant_read_and_assignment_isolation:
  journey: Each authenticated Builder lists and manages only clients associated with its owned projects and units.
  actor_coverage:
    - actor: Builder A
      outcome: Sees only own clients; cannot query Builder B by id or move a client/unit association across projects.
    - actor: Builder B
      outcome: Retains access to its own client list and assignments.
    - actor: Owner
      outcome: Cannot use Builder client-list endpoints.
  scenarios:

      scenario: List filters by token BuilderId; spoofed builder/project filters are denied.
      owner: backend/tests/Modules/Publishing/Management/Api/PublishingAccessTests.cs
    - tier: A

      result: 29/29 passed against the isolated full stack with MySQL 8; tenant-list separation, foreign project/unit attempts, Owner denial, and invitation PII minimization.
    - command: E2E_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:18081 E2E_NGINX=1 E2E_CLOUDINARY_DUMMY=1 E2E_SIMULATED_PAYMENTS=1 npx playwright test tests/e2e/tenant-security.spec.js --workers=1 --repeat-each=2
      result: 2/2 deterministic repeat against isolated MySQL 8.
  convergence_points:
    - Builder A list response excludes Builder B client PII.
    - Cross-builder/project/unit reads and writes are rejected by the API.
    - Public invitation response contains no client or unit PII.
  open_risks:
    - risk: Unit collection endpoints still allow broad authenticated reads and need a separate role/ownership contract.

## Confirmed Builder client UI localization

```yaml
context: publishing
feature: builder-client-list-and-profile-localization
journey: Builder reviews assigned clients, opens add/edit forms, and reads unit-device status in the selected language.
actor_coverage:
  - actor: Builder
    outcome: Client fields, add/edit dialogs, paginator report, unit labels, and linked-device counts remain localized across English and Spanish.
scenarios:
  - tier: B
    scenario: PrimeVue paginator placeholders render as localized values instead of untranslated tokens.
    owner: frontend/tests/e2e/builder-ui-localization.spec.js
  - tier: B
    scenario: Client list, add/edit dialogs, unit/profile copy, and device-count copy update after language switching.
    owner: frontend/tests/e2e/builder-ui-localization.spec.js
layer_ownership:
  G0: Frontend unit suite and production build validate the localized copy helper and assets.
  G1: Client API contract is unchanged; the system journey uses the existing MySQL-backed client endpoints.
  G2: Playwright asserts client visibility, paginator report, both dialogs, and unit-device count for a Builder.
  G3: Tenant isolation and role guards remain covered by `tenant-security.spec.js` and backend access tests.
  G4: The full clean-stack E2E suite passed with one and two workers.
gates:

    result: 30/30 passed against an isolated MySQL 8 stack on the final clean-stack rerun.
artifacts:
  - Playwright traces/screenshots/videos remain under the authorized temporary E2E output folder on failure.
