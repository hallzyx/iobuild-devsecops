# Publishing evidence ledger

See the [crosscutting frontend performance report](../../performance/evidence-ledger.md)
for shared gzip/cache/chunks, functional E2E evidence and the new local
mobile/desktop Lighthouse audit of Builder project list/create/detail and client
list/detail. Exact routes and fixture scope are in the central report. Local
observations do not establish CI acceptance or all-state performance coverage.

The central round-two matrix remeasures these routes after shared header/theme
changes and runs the complete publishing journey twice. No Publishing business
behavior or context-specific CPU optimization changed.

artifacts: []
failures:
  - class: test
    evidence_for: [per-builder cleanup hardcoded to one id left Dupe Towers rows behind across reruns]
    evidence_against: [all other tables cleaned by key]
    verdict: cleanup parameterized by builder id; proven by zero leftovers after consecutive runs
  - class: product
    evidence_for: [project read/update/delete, structure definition, unit creation/assignment, and client create/read/update/delete enforced login but zero ownership]
    evidence_against: [project list already scoped to caller]
    verdict: token-builder ownership on every mutating and item route (403 on explicit mismatch, 404 on foreign ids, creation bound to caller); unfiltered unit and client lists stay visible by design, recorded as scheduled risks
open_risks:
  - risk: unit and client lists have no per-role visibility scoping (frontend depends on unfiltered reads)
