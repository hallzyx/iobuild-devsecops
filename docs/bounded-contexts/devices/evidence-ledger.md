# Devices evidence ledger

## Backend test navigation — 2026-10-02

The [Devices catalogue](test-catalog.md) maps management/control/telemetry and
direct service collaboration. [Reorganization evidence](../../../backend/tests/reorganization-evidence.md)
records source/discovery preservation and local reruns. No broker delivery,
live-Influx/MySQL runtime proof or CI pass is added by this organization-only entry.

See the [crosscutting frontend performance report](../../performance/evidence-ledger.md)
for shared gzip/cache/chunks, functional E2E evidence and the new local
mobile/desktop Lighthouse audit of `/devices/device-management` for Builder and
Owner. The small fixture has no live telemetry samples. Local observations do
not establish CI acceptance or all-state performance coverage.

The central round-two entry records named Owner controls and shared contrasts
(Owner measured A100), plus repeated command/power-lock E2E. CPU reduction is
deferred; shadow refresh and all device widgets remain intact.

reruns:
  - command: dotnet test backend/IoBuild.sln with live MySQL (temporary 3306:3306 mapping, reverted afterwards)
    result: 197/197 green (15 architecture + 20 contract + 41 integration + 121 modules)
  - command: E2E_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8081 npx playwright test (deployed nginx + dist + API + MySQL)
    result: 8/8 green across journeys; e2e and seeded rows cleaned afterwards
flaky_rate:
  observed: 0 unexplained flakes across all reruns above
mutations:
  - mutant: PUT/DELETE ownership checks removed (any user edits any device)
    killed_by: OWNER/BUILDER manage-own plus foreign-404 and anonymous-401 tests
  - mutant: telemetry field guard removed (null payload reaches EF)
    killed_by: minimal-payload partition expecting 400 (proven red 500 without the guard during development)
  - mutant: per-device lock removed (burst corrupts shadow)
    killed_by: CONCURRENT_SAME_DEVICE 8-way burst asserting one coherent shadow
  - mutant: attribute validation removed (garbage actuates)
    killed_by: CONTROL_REJECTS and Tier D fuzz partitions
skip_reasons: []
commands:
  - command: dotnet test backend/tests/Modules --filter DeviceManageTests
    result: 3/3 passed (owner/builder manage own devices, foreign 404, anonymous 401)
  - command: npm run test:unit (frontend)
    result: 32/32 passed (validators 7/7 + iam-contract 7/7 + subscriptions-contract 7/7 + profiles-contract 6/6 + devices-contract 5/5, last local run)
  - command: dotnet test backend/tests/Modules --filter DeviceControlFlowTests
    result: 2/2 passed (command→telemetry→status convergence; wrong role/unit/attribute/range/missing/anonymous rejections)
  - command: IOBUILD_TEST_MYSQL_CONNECTION=... dotnet test --filter DeviceControlMySqlTests (temporary 3306:3306 mapping, reverted afterwards)
    result: 3/3 passed against live MySQL 8.0 (command plus shadow durability, telemetry durability visible on status, per-unit-type duplicate 409 with MAC intentionally ignored on the owner-custom path); probe rows cleaned
  - command: E2E_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8081 npx playwright test (deployed nginx + dist + API + MySQL)
    result: devices-control.spec.js 1/1 green (builder provisions, owner registers with auto-link, brightness from UI, desired state on status endpoint); full suite 8/8; seeded projects/units/clients/devices/users cleaned afterwards
artifacts: []
failures:
  - class: product
    evidence_for: [telemetry ingest without eventId/status/payload threw unhandled DbUpdateException to a 500]
    evidence_against: [ingest is anonymous by design and takes raw device payloads]
    verdict: fail-closed field guard in the endpoint (400); covered by the minimal-payload fuzz partition
  - class: test
    evidence_for: [telemetry recovery rows survived test cleanup and poisoned the next run with duplicate-key failures]
    evidence_against: [all other tables were cleaned]
    verdict: cleanup extended to recovery rows by event key; proven by 3 consecutive green runs
  - class: product
    evidence_for: [PUT and DELETE device endpoints required login but enforced zero ownership: any user could edit or delete any device]
    evidence_against: [create-custom path already checks Owner role plus unit ownership]
    verdict: unit-owner-or-project-builder management check on both endpoints (foreign reads as not found); list stays unfiltered by design, recorded as scheduled risk
open_risks:
  - risk: device list has no per-role visibility scoping (frontend fetches all and filters client-side)
